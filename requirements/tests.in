# chardet is a dependency of requests. It is optional under
# Python 3 but is used if present. Starting with requests v2.26.0,
# requests depends on charset_normalizer that emits a warning in
# our tests:
# ```
# UserWarning: Trying to detect encoding from a tiny portion
# of (12) byte(s).
# ```
# Ref: https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/2ed84f5
# To avoid the warning, we declare a direct dependency on chardet
# here so that it's use is adjusted across Python 2 and Python 3:
requests[use_chardet_on_py3]
