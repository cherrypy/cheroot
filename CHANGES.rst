==========

*(2025-09-21)*


Features
--------

- When load is too high, Cheroot now responds with a 503 Service Unavailable HTTP error.
  Previously it silently closed the connection.

  -- by :user:`itamarst`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`745`.


Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes
---------------------------------------------------

- Cheroot dropped support for Python 3.6 and 3.7.
  It now requires Python 3.8 or later.

  -- by :user:`jaraco`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`565`, :issue:`633`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`437863ee`.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- Declared Python 3.12 and Python 3.13 as supported officially
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`696`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`5db4f634`.

- The minimum version of the ``setuptools-scm`` build dependency
  has been set to 7. The Git archives are now produced by it
  natively, instead of relying on a third party plugin which is
  no longer being used.

  -- by :user:`serhii73`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`628`.

- The packaging metadata has been migrated to the
  :file:`pyproject.toml`-based :pep:`621` declaration
  -- by :user:`jaraco` and :user:`webknjaz`.

  As a part of this update, the minimum version of the
  ``setuptools`` build backend was bumped to 61.2.
  Moreover, any compatibility shims that existed in
  :file:`setup.cfg` and :file:`setup.py` have been
  removed for good.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`690`.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- The test infrastructure has been updated to stop using
  the ``pytest-forked`` plugin
  -- by :user:`jaraco` and :user:`webknjaz`.

  This plugin was causing problems with upgrading to modern
  versions of Pytest and it is not going to be fixed anytime
  soon.

  It was used in a test that interacts with the system
  resource limits under \*NIX environments in hopes to isolate
  the side effects caused by the preparatory code.

  It is possible that this will have an effect on the test
  sessions and we may have to look for alternative solutions
  for test process isolation.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`502`, :issue:`511`, :issue:`680`, :issue:`681`, :issue:`703`.

- The test infrastructure has been updated to start using
  the upstream reusable workflow :file:`reusable-tox.yml`
  from :gh:`tox-dev/workflow` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  This chance allows us to de-duplicate the commonly used
  CI shape.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`743`.

v10.0.1
=======

*(2024-04-22)*


Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed a flaw where internally unhandled exceptions
  could crash the worker threads and eventually starve
  the server of its processing resources. It is no
  longer and issue and the unhandled errors are now
  logged and suppressed except for a few expected
  exceptions that are used for normal interruption
  requests.

  -- by :user:`cameronbrunner` and :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`310`, :issue:`346`, :issue:`354`, :issue:`358`, :issue:`365`, :issue:`375`, :issue:`599`, :issue:`641`, :issue:`649`.

- Fixed compatibility with Python 3.8 in the built-in
  TLS adapter that relies on :py:mod:`python:ssl`.

  Modern Python versions communicate specialized exceptions
  :py:exc:`ssl.SSLEOFError` and :py:exc:`ssl.SSLZeroReturnError`
  where the older versions errored out in a very generic way.

  -- by :user:`toppk` and :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`517`, :issue:`518`.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- Started signing the package distribution artifacts in CI/CD
  with Sigstore and uploading them to GitHub Releases
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`27a3c944`, :commit:`c45f184e`.

- The change log management is now implemented through
  the :std:doc:`Towncrier <towncrier:index>` tool
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  The contributors are now expected to :std:ref:`include
  change log fragment files in their pull requests
  <adding change notes with your prs>`.

  These news snippets can link one or more issues or pull
  requests, and be of one or more of the following categories:

  * ``bugfix``: A bug fix for something we deemed an improper undesired
    behavior that got corrected in the release to match pre-agreed
    expectations.
  * ``feature``: A new behavior, public APIs. That sort of stuff.
  * ``deprecation``: A declaration of future API removals and breaking
    changes in behavior.
  * ``breaking``: When something public gets removed in a breaking way.
    Could be deprecated in an earlier release.
  * ``doc``: Notable updates to the documentation structure or build
    process.
  * ``packaging``: Notes for downstreams about unobvious side effects
    and tooling. Changes in the test invocation considerations and
    runtime assumptions.
  * ``contrib``: Stuff that affects the contributor experience. e.g.
    Running tests, building the docs, setting up the development
    environment.
  * ``misc``: Changes that are hard to assign to any of the above
    categories.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`654`.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- Started type-checking the project with MyPy against a
  range of versions instead of just one — Python 3.8–3.12
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`4fa1e663`, :commit:`676edc4e`, :commit:`be9dbc41`.

- The project how has a :file:`.git-blame-ignore-revs` letting
  GitHub know which auto-formatting revisions to ignore. It is
  also possible to integrate it locally, if one wants to do so.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`5980a3fb`, :commit:`f8a1cc4d`.

- The project adopted the ``autopep8`` tool to assist with
  automatic code formatting. It is chosen over ``black``
  because it is less intrusive which is important to the
  maintainer as it promotes inclusivity.
  ``autopep8`` is integrated into the ``pre-commit`` check
  runner and is configured to only correct :pep:`8`
  violations, avoiding changes to compliant snippets.

  -- by :user:`webknjaz`

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`65ba7e69`.

- The continuous integration and pull request merges have been
  set up to only merge pull requests through merge queues
  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`a7149e0c`.

- Documented the upgraded :std:doc:`release process
  <contributing/release_guide>` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  :commit:`df0d1a08`.

----


v10.0.0
=======

*(2023-05-20)*

- :issue:`504` via :pr:`505`: Cheroot now accepts a
  ``reuse_port`` parameter on the ``HTTPServer`` object.
  Subclasses overriding ``prepare_socket`` will no longer
  work and will need to adapt to the new interface.

v9.0.0
======

*(2022-11-19)*

- :issue:`252` via :pr:`339`: Cheroot now requires Python
  3.6 or later. Python 3.5 and Python 2.7 are still supported
  by the :gh:`maint/8.x branch
  <cherrypy/cheroot/tree/maint/8.x>` and stabilizing
  bugfixes will be accepted to that branch.

v8.6.0
======

*(2022-01-03)*

Significant improvements:

- :issue:`384` via :pr:`385`, :pr:`406`: Exposed type stubs with
  annotations for public API -- by :user:`kasium`.

- :pr:`401` (related to the :pr:`352` effort): Started reusing the
  the ``expriration_interval`` setting as timeout in the low-level
  :py:func:`~select.select` invocation, effectively reducing the system
  load when idle, that is noticeable on low-end hardware systems. On
  Windows OS, due to different :py:func:`~select.select` behavior, the
  effect is less significant and comes with a theoretically decreased
  performance on quickly repeating requests, which has however found
  to be not significant in real world scenarios.
  -- by :user:`MichaIng`.

Internal changes:

- Implemented a manual-trigger-based release workflow.
- Integrated publishing GitHub Releases into the workflow.
- Migrated the docs theme to `Furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo>`__
  (created by :user:`pradyunsg`).
- Attempted to improve the stability of testing.
- Configured the CI to test the same distribution as will be shipped.
- Improved the linting setup and contributor checklists.
- Stopped running tests under Ubuntu 16.04.
- Tweaked the distribution packages metadata to satisfy strict checks.
- Implemented distribution build reproducibility using a pip constraints
  lock-file.
- Added per-environment lock-files into the tox test environments.

v8.5.2
======

*(2021-01-18)*

- :issue:`358` via :pr:`359`: Fixed a regression from
  :pr:`199` that made the worker threads exit on invalid
  connection attempts and could make the whole server
  unresponsive once there was no workers left.
  -- by :user:`cameronbrunner`.

v8.5.1
======

*(2020-12-12)*

- :cp-issue:`1873` via :pr:`340`: Resurrected an
  unintentionally removed feature of interrupting a server
  main thread by externally assigning an exception to the
  :py:meth:`HTTPServer.interrupt <cheroot.server.\
  HTTPServer.interrupt>` property -- by :user:`liamstask`.

- :pr:`350`: Fixed the incarnation of an earlier regression
  of not resetting the serving state
  on :py:data:`~signal.SIGINT` originally fixed by :pr:`322`
  and :pr:`331` but reintroduced by the changes in :pr:`311`
  -- by :user:`liamstask`.

v8.5.0
======

*(2020-12-05)*

- :issue:`305` via :pr:`311`: In
  :py:class:`~cheroot.connections.ConnectionManager`,
  process connections as they become active rather than
  waiting for a ``tick`` event, addressing performance
  degradation introduced in v8.1.0 -- by :user:`liamstask`.

- :issue:`341` via :pr:`342`: Suppress legitimate OS errors
  expected on shutdown -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

v8.4.8
======

*(2020-11-24)*

- :issue:`317` via :pr:`337`: Fixed a regression in
  8.4.5 where the connections dictionary would change
  size during iteration, leading to a :py:exc:`RuntimeError`
  raised in the logs -- by :user:`liamstask`.

v8.4.7
======

*(2020-11-15)*

- :pr:`334`: Started filtering out TLS/SSL errors when
  the version requested by the client is unsupported
  -- by :user:`sanderjo` and :user:`Safihre`.

v8.4.6
======

*(2020-11-15)*

- :issue:`328` via :pr:`322` and :pr:`331`: Fixed a
  regression introduced in the earlier refactoring in v8.4.4
  via :pr:`309` that caused the :py:meth:`~cheroot.server.\
  HTTPServer.serve` method to skip setting
  ``serving=False`` on :py:data:`~signal.SIGINT` and
  :py:data:`~signal.SIGTERM` -- by :user:`marc1n` and
  :user:`cristicbz`.

v8.4.5
======

*(2020-08-24)*

- :issue:`312` via :pr:`313`: Fixed a regression introduced
  in the earlier refactoring in v8.4.4 via :pr:`309` that
  caused the connection manager to modify the selector map
  while looping over it -- by :user:`liamstask`.

- :issue:`312` via :pr:`316`: Added a regression test for
  the error handling in :py:meth:`~cheroot.connections.\
  ConnectionManager.get_conn` to ensure more stability
  -- by :user:`cyraxjoe`.

v8.4.4
======

*(2020-08-12)*

- :issue:`304` via :pr:`309`: Refactored :py:class:`~\
  cheroot.connections.ConnectionManager` to use :py:meth:`~\
  selectors.BaseSelector.get_map` and reorganized the
  readable connection tracking -- by :user:`liamstask`.

- :issue:`304` via :pr:`309`: Fixed the server shutdown
  sequence to avoid race condition resulting in accepting
  new connections while it is being terminated
  -- by :user:`liamstask`.

v8.4.3
======

*(2020-08-12)*

- :pr:`282`: Fixed a race condition happening when an HTTP
  client attempts to reuse a persistent HTTP connection after
  it's been discarded on the server in :py:class:`~cheroot.\
  server.HTTPRequest` but no TCP FIN packet has been received
  yet over the wire -- by :user:`meaksh`.

  This change populates the ``Keep-Alive`` header exposing
  the timeout value for persistent HTTP/1.1 connections which
  helps mitigate such race conditions by letting the client
  know not to reuse the connection after that time interval.

v8.4.2
======

*(2020-07-28)*

- Fixed a significant performance regression introduced in
  v8.1.0 (:issue:`305` via :pr:`308`) - by :user:`mar10`.

  The issue turned out to add 0.1s delay on new incoming
  connection processing. We've lowered that delay to mitigate
  the problem short-term, better fix is yet to come.

v8.4.1
======

*(2020-07-26)*

- Prevent :py:exc:`ConnectionAbortedError` traceback from being
  printed out to the terminal output during the app start-up on
  Windows when built-in TLS adapter is used (:issue:`302` via
  :pr:`306`) - by :user:`mxii-ca`.

v8.4.0
======

*(2020-07-23)*

- Converted management from low-level :py:func:`~select.select` to
  high-level :py:mod:`selectors` (:issue:`249` via :pr:`301`)
  - by :user:`tommilligan`.

  This change also introduces a conditional dependency on
  ``selectors2`` as a fall-back for legacy Python interpreters.

v8.3.1
======

*(2020-07-13)*

- Fixed TLS socket related unclosed resource warnings
  (:pr:`291` and :pr:`298`).
- Made terminating keep-alive connections more graceful
  (:issue:`263` via :pr:`277`).

v8.3.0
======

*(2020-02-09)*

- :cp-issue:`910` via :pr:`243`: Provide TLS-related
  details via WSGI environment interface.
- :pr:`248`: Fix parsing of the ``--bind`` CLI option
  for abstract UNIX sockets.


v8.2.1
======

*(2019-10-17)*

- :cp-issue:`1818`: Restore support for ``None``
  default argument to ``WebCase.getPage()``.


v8.2.0
======

*(2019-10-14)*

- Deprecated use of negative timeouts as alias for
  infinite timeouts in ``ThreadPool.stop``.

v8.1.0
======

*(2019-10-09)*

- Workers are now request-based, addressing the
  long-standing issue with keep-alive connections
  (:issue:`91` via :pr:`199`).


v8.0.0
======

*(2019-10-09)*

- :issue:`231` via :pr:`232`: Remove custom ``setup.cfg``
  parser handling, allowing the project (including ``sdist``)
  to build/run on setuptools 41.4. Now building cheroot
  requires setuptools 30.3 or later (for declarative
  config support) and preferably 34.4 or later (as
  indicated in ``pyproject.toml``).


v7.0.0
======

*(2019-09-26)*

- :pr:`224`: Refactored "open URL" behavior in
  :py:mod:`~cheroot.test.webtest` to rely on `retry_call
  <https://jaracofunctools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#jaraco.functools.retry_call>`_.
  Callers can no longer pass ``raise_subcls`` or ``ssl_context``
  positionally, but must pass them as keyword arguments.


v6.6.0
======

*(2019-09-25)*

- Revisit :pr:`85` under :pr:`221`. Now
  ``backports.functools_lru_cache`` is only
  required on Python 3.2 and earlier.
- :cp-issue:`1206` via :pr:`204`: Fix race condition in
  threadpool shrink code.


v6.5.8
======

*(2019-09-05)*

- :issue:`222` via :commit:`621f4ee`: Fix

  toggling stats counting in the middle of request processing.

- Improve post Python 3.9 compatibility checks.

- Fix support of `abstract namespace sockets
  <https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks
  /space/blog/linux/SocketAbstractNamespace>`_.

v6.5.6
======

*(2019-08-19)*

- :issue:`218` via :pr:`219`: Fix HTTP parser to return 400 on
  invalid major-only HTTP version in Request-Line.


v6.5.5
======

*(2019-04-25)*

- :issue:`99` via :pr:`186`: Sockets now collect statistics (bytes
  read and written) on Python 3 same as Python 2.

- :cp-issue:`1618` via :pr:`180`: Ignore OpenSSL's 1.1+ Error 0

v5.5.0
======

*(2017-05-02)*

- :issue:`17` via :pr:`25`: Instead of a read_headers function, cheroot now
  supplies a :py:class:`HeaderReader <cheroot.server.HeaderReader>` class to
  perform the same function.

  Any :py:class:`HTTPRequest <cheroot.server.HTTPRequest>` object may override
  the header_reader attribute to customize the handling of incoming headers.

  The server module also presents a provisional implementation of
  a :py:class:`DropUnderscoreHeaderReader
  <cheroot.server.DropUnderscoreHeaderReader>` that will exclude any headers
  containing an underscore. It remains an exercise for the
  implementer to demonstrate how this functionality might be
  employed in a server such as CherryPy.

- :pr:`26`: Configured TravisCI to run tests under OS X.
