The :py:mod:`cheroot.ssl.builtin` SSL adapter now responds with a
``400 Bad Request`` error to plaintext HTTP requests on HTTPS ports by detecting
them before the SSL handshake, matching the behavior of
:py:mod:`cheroot.ssl.pyopenssl`. Previously, such requests would fail during
the SSL handshake without sending an HTTP response.
