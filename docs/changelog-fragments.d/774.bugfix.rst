Resolved various issues that were causing mypy stubtest errors:
1. Added missing __all__ declarations in server.pyi and threadpool.pyi
   to match their corresponding Python modules.
2. Removed cheroot.connections.IS_WINDOWS from stubtest_allowlist.txt
   and added IS_WINDOWS as a bool to connections.pyi instead.
