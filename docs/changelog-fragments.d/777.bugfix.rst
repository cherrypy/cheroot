The changes in timeout values address two issues:
1. The test_keepalive_conn_management test was intermittently
failing in CI with http.client.NotConnected.
This was due to the combined execution time of test logic and
the explicit time.sleep() exceeding the server timeout (2.0s).

2. The http_request_timeout was also too short and causing
failures in test_http_over_https_error().
