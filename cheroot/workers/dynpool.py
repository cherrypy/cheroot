"""Dynamic pool.

`dynpool <https://tabo.pe/projects/dynpool/>`_ is a Python
library that handles the growing and shrinking of a pool
of resources depending on usage patterns,
written by `Gustavo Pic√≥n <https://tabo.pe/>`_ and
licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

``dynpool`` doesn't handle pools directly, and has no
concept of connections, threads or processes. That should be
dealt in a provided pool object. ``dynpool`` only handles
the growing and shrinking of resources in the given pool
object, and for that, the pool must follow an interface:


.. py:class:: PoolInterface


   .. py:attribute:: size

      The number of resources in the pool at the moment. Includes
      idle and used resources.

   .. py:attribute:: idle

      The number of idle resources in the pool at the moment.
      ``dynpool`` will either :py:meth:`grow` or :py:meth:`shrink`
      idle resources depending on the values of
      `minspare` and `maxspare` in :py:class:`dynpool.DynamicPoolResizer`.

   .. py:attribute:: min

      The minimum number of resources that should be in the pool.
      ``dynpool`` will :py:meth:`grow` the pool if :py:attr:`size`
      is lower than this value.


   .. py:attribute:: max

      The maximum number of resources that should be in the pool.
      ``dynpool`` won't grow the pool beyond this point, and will
      try to :py:meth:`shrink` it as soon as resources are freed.

      If max has a negative value, there won't be a limit for
      resource growth.

   .. py:attribute:: qsize

      The size of the incoming jobs queue that will be handled by
      idle resources.

   .. py:method:: grow(amount)

      Creates ``amount`` new idle resources in the pool.

   .. py:method:: shrink(amount)

      Shrinks the pool by ``amount`` resources.


Example

.. code-block:: python

    import dynpool
    from example_code import SomeThreadPool, run_periodically

    # A user provided thread pool that follows the interface
    # expected by DynamicPoolResizer.
    pool = SomeThreadPool(min=3, max=30)

    # We create a thread pool monitor.
    monitor = dynpool.DynamicPoolResizer(pool, minspare=5, maxspare=10)

    # Creating a thread pool monitor does nothing. We need to
    # call it's run() method periodically. Let's do it every second.
    run_periodically(monitor.run, interval=1)
